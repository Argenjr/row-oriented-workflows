Thinking inside the box: you can do that inside a data frame?!

## Abstract

The data frame is a crucial data structure in R and, especially, in the tidyverse. Working on a column or a variable is a very natural operation, which is great. But what about row-oriented work? That also comes up frequently and is more awkward. In this webinar I’ll work through concrete code examples, exploring patterns that arise in data analysis. We’ll discuss the general notion of “split-apply-combine”, row-wise work in a data frame, splitting vs. nesting, and list-columns.
